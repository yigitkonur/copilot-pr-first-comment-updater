This repository contains a Python script that automatically updates the first comments of closed pull requests in a specified GitHub repository. The script appends the copilot:all label to the first comment, allowing you to identify PRs that have been processed by the script.

The script uses the PyGithub library to interact with the GitHub API and can be easily configured by providing a personal access token and the target repository name.

### Key features:

- Processes all closed pull requests in the specified GitHub repository
- Appends the copilot:all label to the first comment of each PR
- Skips PRs that have already been processed or have a 'Generated by Copilot' label
- Provides clear output for each processed PR and any skipped PRs
- This tool is useful for developers who want to automatically update PR comments for tracking purposes or to improve the management of closed PRs in a project.

To use the script, simply clone the repository, install the required dependencies, and configure your GitHub personal access token and target repository name in the script.
